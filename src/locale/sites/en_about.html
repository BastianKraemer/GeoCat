<h2>What is GeoCat?</h2>
<p>GeoCat is an open source Geo-Caching application which is running in your web browser by using latest technologies like HTML5.</p>


<p>This application has been developed within the context of a study project.
If you want to learn how to use GeoCat, the best way to to this is &bdquo;Trail and error&ldquo;<br>
All icons have been used in all conscience to provide an optimal usability.</p>

<blockquote>Don't be afraid of unlabeled buttons or icons, infer the actions in the most cases out of the context.
In the case you even don't know what the button is for: GeoCat will always ask you to confirm the operation before it performs actions that can't be undone.</blockquote>

<h2>What do I need to get started?</h2>

<p>You just need three things:</p>

<ol>
<li>A GeoCat user account - it needs less than one minute to sign up.</li>
<li>An up-to-date web browser wih HTML5 support (take a look at "Supported web browsers") and a device with GPS-Support</li>
<li>A full charged battery: The GPS tracking increases the energy consumption of your device</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>GeoCat won't need an internet uplink as long as you are walking to any cache of a challenge.
The internet connection is only necessary when you have reached your destination.</blockquote>

<h2>Geo-Caching and Geo-Tracking</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Geo-Caching</dt>
<dd>is a kind of scavenger hunt using GPS. You don't know the route to your destination, but you know its GPS coordinates,
so you can calculate the way.</dd>

<dt>Geo-Tracking</dt>
<dd>The term Geo-Tracking describes the tracking or recording of your GPS position to trace your covered track</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Tips and tricks</h2>
<p>The navigation using the GeoCat compass works very well on most devices, but there are a few things you have to know before you are getting started:</p>
<p>Due to the fact that GeoCat is a pure web application it isn't possible to use the internal compass which is integrated in many Smartphones.
Because of this reason the only way to detect your moving direction is when you are moving.
So the GeoCat compass will only display the right orientation when you are walking straightforward in the same direction for a while.
If you turn on the spot, the compass will most likely display something incorrect.</p>
<p>Another thing that may happen is a reduced compass size after zoom gesture ore a device rotation.
You can simply correct this by rotating the device again.</p>

<h2>Where is this data stored?</h2>
<p>To deal with your GPS position is a core feature of GeoCat, but the processing will always be performed on your device and is only 
sent to the server if you explicitly allow this. This can occur in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>In challenges:</strong><br>
	If you want to set a cache as 'reached'. In this case the server will store the time you have reached this cache.
	<li><strong>If you are creating new destinations:</strong><br>
	Every time you store a new coordinate on the server you have the possibility to use your current position.
	<li><strong>By activating the tracking function:</strong><br>
	GeoCat has a tracking mode, which will send your GPS position every 30 seconds to the GeoCat server. This is necessary to share your current position with your friends.
	This feature allows you to navigate to your friends or to track their movement (at least if you authorized them to do so).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Supported Browsers</h2>
<p>Basicly you can use any browser that supports HTML5. The following web browsers are officially supported:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Firefox 40+ and Firefox Mobile</li>
	<li>Microsoft Edge</li>
	<li>Google Chrome</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><strong>Note::</strong> The HTML5 support of all versions of the Internet-Explorer is not sufficent enough to use all features of GeoCat.</blockquote>
